# Genetic-Algorithm
A Genetic algorithm, aimed at finding maxima of any 2 variable function.

The equation has to be written as a part of the fitness function.

fitness() function by defaults finds the maxima for: f(x,y) = x^2 +y^2
fitness1() functions by defaults finds maxima for : f(x,y) = (x^2-y)^2  + (1-x)^2

The domain of x and y can be fixed.

The program does specific number of runs, for the specified number of generations, and plots the average fitness (output of the function), for each generation.
